.SH DESCRIPTION
libjodycode is a software code library containing code shared among several of
the programs written by Jody Bruchon such as imagepile, jdupes, winregfs, and
zeromerge. These shared pieces of code were copied between each program as
they were updated. As the number of programs increased and keeping these
pieces of code synced became more annoying, the decision was made to combine
all of them into a single reusable shared library.
